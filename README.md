The Intelligent Autonomous Disinfection Sterilizing Robot (iADSRob) is an innovative 
solution designed to automate the disinfection process in healthcare facilities and public 
environments, aiming to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. In response to the 
global demand for efficient and contactless sanitation technologies, iADSRob integrates 
autonomous navigation, intelligent path planning, and object detection to target high
contact surfaces such as door handles, hospital beds, equipment, and workspaces. 
The robot is equipped with a LiDAR-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and 
Mapping) system for real-time environment mapping and localization, allowing it to 
autonomously navigate complex indoor environments while avoiding obstacles. A vision
based module enables selective spraying to avoid humans and target only relevant 
surfaces. The system includes two tanks for disinfection and sterilization liquids, with 
real-time level monitoring displayed on a mounted tablet via a custom-built Android 
application. Powered by a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, the robot uses a combination of 
sensor inputs, motor drivers, and peristaltic pumps to control movement and disinfection 
functions. The project also emphasizes user safety, chemical control, and operational 
efficiency. This report details the full design process of the robot, from conceptualization 
and mechanical assembly to software development and testing. It also includes a review 
of existing disinfection systems, the justification for using autonomous and intelligent 
methods, system architecture, implementation constraints, performance evaluation, and a 
business model outlining market potential. iADSRob demonstrates a practical 
implementation of smart robotics in healthcare and sanitation, contributing to safer, 
cleaner environments with minimal human intervention.
